    <h1>EDEX</h1>
    <h3>Brand re-design</h3>
    <h2>Goal of the project</h2>
    <p>Redesign the online presence and <br>
      creating an educational tool that is <br>
      relevant and engaging</p>
    <h4>Requirments</h4>
    <p1>This project required tons of research on 
      gamification<br> and ways to implement it
      into the design process as<br> well as
      prove that it works.
    </p1>
    <h5>Background</h5>
    <p2>The existing EDEX website suffered from usability issues, navigation 
      issues and visual issues. The primary challenge was to redesign the
      website and encourage users to use the educational tool provided.</p2>
    <h6>Process</h6>
    <p3>My first step was to identify the flaws in the current website where I 
      conducted user testing. Next I researched ways to mediate those
      flaws and implement them into my design. EDEX did not have any
      guidelines for what sort of design they wanted so I had to conduct
      countless tests to see which designs would encourage the user
      to remain on the website longer as well as working directly with the 
      shareholders to make sure everything is how they imagine it.

    <h1>OCC</h1>
    <h3>Business Concept</h3>
    <h2>Goal of the project</h2>
    <p>Creating a fertilizer production and distribution 
      company based in Oman. <br> The primary focus is on manufacturing high-quality 
      fertilizers to meet the <br>diverse agricultural needs of the Omani market.</p>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p2>I had the idea to create OCC after I heard that the price of fertilizer has increased<br> by 4 times. I saw this as a great opportunity
      to learn more about the world fertilizer<br> market and understand the needs/wants of its users. I studied and created different<br> versions
      of the fertilizer that was being sold such as nitrogen-based, phosphorus-based<br> and potassium-based fertilizers as a way of understanding
      what I am trying to market.<br> I decided to base the company in my home country of Oman as a way of helping to<br> develop Oman's private market and
      because I saw it as a way of adding <br>something to Oman. 
    </p2>
    <h5>Process</h5>
    <p3>I first researched about why the price of fertilizer has <br>skyrocketed in the past couple of years, followed by <br>an indepth study on the types of fertilizer
      and what <br>would be the most realisitic for a desert. Afterwards I <br>conducted learned about how to create some<br> nitrogen-based fertilizer and created my first sample!<br>
      Creating it was a difficult process as I had little experience <br>in chemistry but I was fortunate enough to have a friend <br>who studied chemistry and he gave me 
      a helping hand when<br> creating it. I created a business plan and a presentation to present my research and testing to a type of "shark tank" event that was setup in my university
      and was able to convince the sharks to invest in my idea :)
